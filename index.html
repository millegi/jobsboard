			  <h3>The Job:</h3>
			  <p>As an Associate QA Engineer, we are looking for someone who is very eager to participate in improvement initiatives. Someone who loves to develop <b>quality assurance plans or test plans</b> and follow issues through to resolution. Afterall, one of your major responsibilities will be to <b>test the system thoroughly</b> using methods like <b>black box and regressing testing,</b> before making anything live.
			  <br/>
			  This role will also demand for you to think outside the box to <b>push the system to its limit</b> by including the edge cases in test plans. You will of course conduct research on the requirements so that you create the most optimal test scenario. But this also means you will use the existing tools and techniques to execute test cases, but if those tools don’t exist, <b>you will build/ script new tools for testing and validation.</b>
			  <br/>
			  Along with the exciting part, most roles also have the day-to-day administrative part, which might not sound as exciting, but are essential to be consistent and effective. For this role, it consists of participation in <b>sprint planning,</b> and <b>working with product owners</b> to understand the functional requirements while also <b>collaborating with developers</b> in analysing the story to estimate the QA efforts. You will also be <b>documenting, tracking and escalating issues</b> as appropriate using bug tracking tools.</p>
			  <h3>The Fit:</h3>
			  <p>The ideal candidate will be a great team player who loves to work closely with others to ensure the delivery of high quality results. You will be someone who, by nature, is curious and looks into details of things. You also demonstrate true ownership which means when you see an issue, regardless of whether or not it falls under your job description, you take the initiative to address it. Issues that you deal with vary in nature and can come from multiple sources, so you are logical and open-minded in your approach and also have be ability to learn quickly.</p>
			  <br/>
			  <h3>The Experience:</h3>
			  <p>You have a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Engineering or related field and between a year to two years of work experience in related field.</p>
